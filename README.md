DECISION TREE LEARNING

A Decision Tree is a supervised Machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by splitting the dataset into branches based on feature values, forming a tree-like structure. Each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, branches represent the outcome of that decision, and leaf nodes represent the final prediction or output.


Applications
●	Fraud Detection: By identifying patterns in labeled data, decision trees assist in detecting fraudulent transactions.
●	Customer segmentation: They help with focused marketing campaigns by grouping clients according to their purchasing patterns.
●	Predictive maintenance uses past data to forecast when equipment will break down.
●	Healthcare: Diagnosing diseases based on patient symptoms.

2. Core Concepts
Entropy
Entropy quantifies the degree of uncertainty or impurity in a dataset. It is employed to assess the split quality at every Decision Tree node. A purer dataset and less unpredictability are indicated by lower entropy.
 
Information Gain
Information Gain After a split, information gain quantifies the decrease in entropy. A better split is indicated by a bigger Information Gain.
 
Gini Impurity
The probability of erroneously identifying a randomly selected sample is measured by Gini Impurity. It is Scikit-learn's default splitting criterion.

Strengths
●	Decision trees are simple to use and interpret.
●	They manage numerical and categorical data without requiring a lot of preparation.

Limitations
●	Prone to overfitting in the absence of appropriate tuning (limiting tree depth, for example).
●	sensitive to data outliers and noise.


Recommendations
●	To increase performance, employ ensemble techniques like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
●	Try varying hyperparameters such as min_samples_leaf and min_samples_split.
